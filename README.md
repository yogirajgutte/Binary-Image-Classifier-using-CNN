# Binary-Image-Classifier-using-CNN
In this project, I have used Convolutional Neural Network to classify two different objects by extracting their features. I have used it to classify images of pizza and softdrink.
I have provided Python file and Jupyter Notebook file. Use any according to your convenience.
You can train the model with your own dataset consisting of images of two different objects.
Just take care about the file addresses.

I have trained the model using a dataset of 8400 images of Pizzas and Softdrinks.
If you wish to test my model, download the 'pizza_vs_softdrink_architecture.json' file and extract all the zip files of weight to obtain single weight file.
Then import both of the files using the code provided at the end of the program.
You can test using your own test set and you may also train my pretrained model to improve its accuracy.
